Title: Exponential Tilting Method for Reproducible Screening of Large
        Scale Testing Problem
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Chong Ma

Description: Develop an exponential tilting method by conditioning on the false discovery rate to tilt a two component mixture of Beta distributions, yielding an tilted mixture model. Use a Boosted EM algorithm to fit a two-component mixture of Beta distributions for p-values or left tail areas of test statistics. The Boosted EM algorithm for the mixture model fitting is built in C++, which is quite fast and stable. The package also includes two utility functions to generate tilted false discovery rates and frequency network.
